# Discord-Welcome-Bot-And-Scheduled-Message
A discord bot which serves the function of sending a `welcome message` with a gif at the end to users who enter your server and also has the functionality of sending a `scheduled message` in the channel you want and at the time you want.

# Folder
you need to create a `folder` in which your bot files are saved and you will open it in your `VScode`

# Node.js
You need to install node.js to be able to use the code that can be seen in the `/index.js` file

# Install
In your `VScode` you will need to use these installation codes before your bot can start working:              
```
npm init -y
```                                                                                                                   
```
npm install discord.js
```
# Index.js
Download my `Index.js` file and paste it in the folder you created for your bot, then reopen said folder in your `VScode` and you could start configuring the parameters of your `Bot`          
or                                                                                                                   
Create an `Index.js` file in your `VScode`, copy the code that appears in my `repository`, paste it into the file you just created and you should now start configuring the parameters of your `Bot`

# execute
Once you have configured all the `parameters` of your bot in the `Index.js` file, use the following command to `execute` the code:                                        
```
node .
```
